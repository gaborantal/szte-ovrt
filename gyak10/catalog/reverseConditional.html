<P><I><CENTER>
You have a conditional that would be easier to understand if you reversed its sense.
</CENTER></I></P>
<P><B><CENTER>
Reverse the sense of the conditional and reorder the conditional's clauses.
</CENTER></B></P>

<PRE>
 if ( !isSummer( date ) )
  charge = winterCharge( quantity );
 else
  charge = summerCharge( quantity );
</PRE>

<PRE>
 if ( isSummer( date ) )
  charge = summerCharge( quantity );
 else
  charge = winterCharge( quantity );
</PRE>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<P>
Often conditionals can be phrased in way that makes them hard to read. This is particularly the case when they have a not in front of them. If the conditional only has a "then" clause and no "else" clause, this is reasonable. However if the conditional has both clauses, then you might as well reverse the conditional.</P>

<h2>Mechanics</h2>
<UL>
<LI>Remove negative from conditional.</LI>
<LI>Switch clauses</LI>
<LI>Compile and test.</LI>
</UL>
<P>There's <A href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?RefactorNegateIf">further discussion</A> on this kind of refactoring on the wiki.
