Create a constant, name it after the meaning, and replace the number with it.</CENTER></B></P>

<h2>Additional Comments</h2>
<h3>Using a constant method</h3>
<P>For this refactoring I used a symbolic constant, which is the most common Java idiom.
</P>
<P>However an alternative is the constant method, which is a method of this form
</P>
<PRE>
public static double gravitationalConstant() {
	return 9.81;
}
</PRE>
<P> This idiom is less familiar to C based programmers, but is very familiar to Smalltalkers (who didn't have constants in their language). On the whole I don't tend to use this in Java as it is less idiomatic to the language. However if you need to replace the simple return with a calculated value then it's worth changing the constant field to a constant method. (I guess there should be a refactoring for that....)
</P>
