Move Class</H1>

<P><I><CENTER>
You have a class that is in a package that contains other classes that it is not related to in function. 
</CENTER></I></P>
<P><B><CENTER>
Move the class to a more relevant package. Or create a new package if required for future use.
</CENTER></B></P>

<PRE>
<PRE>

class org.davison.ui.TextThing
class org.davison.ui.TextProcessor
class org.davison.log.Logger

depends on 

class org.davison.ui.StringUtil

</PRE>

class org.davison.ui.TextThing
class org.davison.ui.TextProcessor
class org.davison.log.Logger

depends on

class org.davison.util.StringUtil


</PRE>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<P>
Classes are often created in a packages close to where they are being used, this can make sense until the class starts to be re-used by other parts of the product. The package in question might also have just become too big. (I have a preference that my packages never have more than about 10 classes)
</P>
<P>
It is often better to move to this class to a package more related to it in form or function. This can help remove complex package level dependencies and make it easier for developers to find and re-use classes.
</P>
<P>
If there are many dependencies for the class within its own package, then Extract Class could be used first to split out the relevant parts.
</P>
<P>
Another example where is this used often is to move String resource objects into sub a res package to simplify localization compilation.
</P>


<h2>Mechanics</h2>
<UL>
<LI>Move the class to its new folder on the source tree.</LI>
<LI>Remove any class files generated from compiling this class at its old location.</LI>
<LI>Alter the package statement in the source file to reflect the new package.</LI>
<LI>Create import statements for any dependant classes in original package. </LI>
<LI>Compile and test the class in its new package, updating and moving unit tests as required using this same method.</LI>
<LI>Alter, and create in some cases, the import statements on any dependee class. Note this is easier if wide imports are not used.</LI>
<LI>Check for classes that might dynamically instantiate this class using java.lang.reflect or the ResourceBundle api. Also look for code that might reference this class as an absolute class literal.</LI>
<LI>Compile and test all code that was dependant on the original class.</LI>
<LI>Consider applying <A href="extractPackage.html">
Extract Package</A> when you have many classes of different functionality in a given package.</LI>
</UL>
<h2>Example</h2>
<UL>
<P>
Lets look at the header of StringUtil</P>

<PRE>

package org.davison.ui

// imports

public class StringUtil

...

</PRE>
<P>
We move the file and change the package header.
</P>
<PRE>

package org.davison.util

// imports

public class StringUtil

...

</PRE>
<P>
I can now compile and unit test this class in its new package. If the unit tests are in a different package class file then they might need to be updated.
</P>
<P>
I can now go on to update the dependant classes. For example here I update the import statements, I have not used a wide imports in this example but the principle is the same.
</P>
<PRE>



package org.davison.log

// imports

import org.davison.ui.StringUtils;

// more imports

public class Logger

...

</PRE>
<P>
This becomes:
</P>
<PRE>


package org.davison.log

// imports

import org.davison.util.StringUtils;

// more imports

public class Logger

...


</PRE>

<P>
Again compile and test this new class with the imports.
</P>
<P>
As mentioned before there are other ways of dynamically loading classes. You may have to look for class literals and strings constants containing the fully qualified name of the old class.
</P>
<PRE>



// A class literal

public Class m_utils = org.davison.ui.StringUtils.class;

// A dynamically loaded class

public Class m_utils = Class.forName("org.davison.ui.StringUtils");

// A loaded resource bundle

public ResourceBundle m_bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(
   "org.davison.ui.StringUtils");



</PRE>

<P>
These can be fixed using simple find and replaces, these dynamic examples will also be found using the units tests for all classes.
</P>


<PRE>



// A class literal, this will be found by the compiler.

public Class m_utils = org.davison.util.StringUtils.class;

// A dynamically loaded class

public Class m_utils = Class.forName("org.davison.util.StringUtils");

// A loaded resource bundle

public ResourceBundle m_bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(
   "org.davison.util.StringUtils");



</PRE>


<P>
One all static and dynamic cases have been dealt with, and all unit tests have run. The refactoring is complete.
</P>


</UL>
