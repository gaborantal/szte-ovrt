<h2>Additional Comments</h2>
<h3>Using with try/catch blocks</h3>
<P>Paul Haahr rightly took me to task for being far too glib when I talked about consolidating with exceptions. You can only pull repeated code into a final block if all non-fatal exceptions are caught. This is because the finally block is executed after any exception, including those that don't have a catch clause. (Of course you may prefer that to happen, but that's not a semantics preserving change.)
